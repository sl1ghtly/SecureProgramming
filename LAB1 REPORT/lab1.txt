Bug 1:

In addCashier.java, on line 54, there is a pass variable storing the input of the passwordField using getText(),
since the method is deprecated, it is important that we change it to getPassword().

Deprecated classes are methods that are no longer important and shouldn't be used at all. It is better to remove them
because they could not exist in a few years.

Bug 2:

In addProduct.java, on line 67, there are two items being compared using == rather than using the equals() method.
It is better to use the equals method because that way we are able to compare their primitive values.

The == and!= operators compare object references rather than object values,
which is why they cannot directly compare the values of boxed primitives.
